"Big Data" formats/techniques for informatics programming
==============
This document covers various ways to handle large data sets, with an emphasis on "bionformatics" applications.  Rather than cover "standard" formats (BAM, VCF, etc.), the emphasis is on how a programmer may effectively handle large data sets using formats other than plain ASCII text.

Example code is centered on C/C++.
