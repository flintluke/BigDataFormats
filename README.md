"Big Data" formats/techniques for informatics programming
==============
This document covers various ways to handle large data sets, with an emphasis on "bionformatics" applications.  Rather than cover "standard" formats (BAM, VCF, etc.), the emphasis is on how a programmer may effectively handle large data sets using formats other than plain ASCII text.

Example code is centered on C/C++, and a basic understanding of those languages is assumed.

We will start with gzip output, which is probably what most people will think of when wishing to move beyond plain text.  gzip is a great format, but not necessarily the most convenient for programming in languages like C/C++.  As we move down the list of formats and techniques, we'll end up with formats that are more and more convenient, while also being very efficient.

#What features do we want in our "Big Data" programs?

1.  File output size isn't too big, but we want to write feweer larger files rather than millions of tiny files.
2.  We should generally write large blocks of data, rather than printing to a file every time we get an answer

Gzipped
=======
A gzipped or ".gz" file is probably the simplest way to move away from plain text files.  The final output is the same, but the file size is much smaller.

You get .gz output via the use of the [zlib](http://zlib.net) run-time library.  This library is a C-language interface to gzip compression, and provideds function-for-function analogs to many of the C-library \<stdio.h\> read, write, fprintf, etc. that C programmers will be familiar with.

The zlib [manual](http://zlib.net/manual.html) is excellent and straightforward.  I recommend making sure that you have version >= 1.2.5 on your system, which provides the _gzbuffer_ function.

The basics (C):

```{c}
#include <zlib.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( int argc, char ** argv )
{
  /*
    Open in write mode.  
    Use a for append mode.
    This is analzgous to fopen
  */
  gzFile  gzfp = gzopen("file.gz","wb"); 
  double x = 10.0;

  /*We need a buffer for input*/
  char buffer[sizeof(double)];
  int rv;

  /* gzprintf works just like fprintf */
  gzprintf( gzfp, "%lf\n", x );
  
  gzclose( gzfp ); /*same as fclose*/
  
  /*now, read it back in*/
  gzfp = gzopen("file.gz","rb");
  
  /* there is no gzscanf!!!, so we use gzread, and we must read into a char * buffer */
  rv=gzread( gzfp, buffer, sizeof(double) );
  
  fprintf(stderr,"%d %s\n",rv,buffer);
  
  exit(0);
}
```

As you can see, the absence of a _gzscanf_ function makes reading the data tiresome.

Of course, the basic use of zlib is identical in C++.  However, C++ make is very easy for us to buffer output from various sources.  The _std::ostringstream_ is more convenient than the C-language equavalent:

```{c++}
#include <zlib.h>

#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main( int argc, char ** argv )
{
  ostringstream buffer;

  gzFile out = gzopen("test.gz","wb");
  for( unsigned i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
    {
      buffer << "record number: " << i << '\n';
    }

  /*
    Write the buffer in one fell swoop.
    buffer.str().c_str() returns the char * is the buffer's internal data.
    buffer.str().size() is the size of the buffer in bytes b/c sizeof(char) = 1

    PRO tip:
    In more complex programs, write to buffer until buffer.str().size() >= some maximum value.
    At that point, write buffer to file, then reset buffer's internal data to empty string as follows:
    buffer.str( string() );

    The above command re-initializes the buffer with an empty string.
  */
  int rv = gzwrite( out, buffer.str().c_str(), buffer.str().size() );
  cerr << rv << " bytes written\n";

  //Be sure to close the file, else you may not see your data!!
  gzclose(out);
}
```

Pros of gzip:

1. Small output
2. Files are seekable and appendable.  This means you can build external indexes to rapidly find your data, etc.
3. Efficient

Cons:

1. Not totally convenient.  Have to read data back into buffers and then convert it to desired formats.  Bit of a drag.
2.
